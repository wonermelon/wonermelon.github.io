				<sup>1</sup>On March 31st of 2001, at the stroke of midnight in Quezon City, <b>Marian Denise Europa Dagunton</b> was born. 
				<sup>2</sup>She was the only daughter among five children of a computer programmer father and a dentist mother. 
				<sup>3</sup>Her parents are <b><i>Dennis B. Dagunton</b></i> and <b><i>Phona Europa Dagunton</b></i>, while her siblings are <b><i>Dominique, Vincent, Jaime,</b></i> and <b><i>Luis Dagunton.</b></i>
				<sup>4</sup>Growing up, she spent most of her childhood days playing with her siblings.
				<sup>5</sup>Since all of her siblings were all boys, she grew up being <i><q>boyish</q></i> because even though she had girl toys, she would always borrow the ones her brothers had.
				<sup>6</sup>They used to live in Bulacan province then eventually moved to Taguig City when she turned 5.
				<sup>7</sup>She had a deep appreciation for nature and the environment, so much that she would spend most of her time outdoors.
				<sup>8</sup>She often greeted and talked to stray animals and even insects as if they were humans.
				<sup>9</sup>At the age of 5 years old, she attended a small private school in Taguig and was an avid learner.
				<sup>10</sup>She grew up with a fascination for subjects such as math, science, and english. 
				<sup>11</sup>She enjoyed reading books, exploring nature, and writing, even joining a journalism club for a few years.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<sup>12</sup>Her interest in dancing was sparked by watching Jabbawockeez on the television show <i>"World of Dance,"</i> leading her to imitate their moves and perform for others in school and at family gatherings.
				<sup>13</sup>She pursued her passion in dancing and often performed on stage, where she participated in various dance competitions.
				<sup>14</sup>But her parents eventually forced her to stop dancing due to her heart condition.
				<sup>15</sup>It made her very sad and she really did not want to stop dancing, but she had no choice. 
				<sup>16</sup>Although she seemed like a very active child, Marian was actually quiet and introverted who spent much of her time lost in her imagination.
				<sup>17</sup>And she used that wide imagination of hers to write stories instead.
				<sup>18</sup>She considered writing as a coping mechanism because she never felt like she belonged anywhere.
				<sup>19</sup><strong>At least in her stories, she had complete control over every situation; she could write anything and make it a happy ending for the characters, <em>she thought</em>.</strong>
				<sup>20</sup>Marian had experienced different kinds of abuse since she was four years old, and as a result, she grew up being overly sensitive and empathic toward everyone because she did not want anyone else to go through what she had and feel the same way she did.
				<sup>21</sup>Growing up, she never told anyone about the abuses she has been experiencing because she knew at a very young age that telling others would cause chaos, and that was something she never wanted to happen.
				<sup>22</sup>She was too selfless and naive to believe that she would rather suffer alone than see the people she cared about get hurt.

				<sup>1</sup><b><i>Marian tried her hardest to live a normal life despite her tragic childhood. </b></i>
				<sup>2</sup>In her teenage years, Marian's passion for writing continued to flourish. 
				<sup>3</sup>She also discovered her love for photography and would spend hours taking photos of nature and city landscapes.
				<sup>4</sup>She taught herself how to use a DSLR, and how to capture photos properly. 
				<sup>5</sup>She also learned color grading, and photo manipulation techniques using different editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
				<sup>6</sup>She also became interested in history and started reading history books owned by her grandparents.
				<sup>7</sup>She has always been interested in the power of words and the law, but it wasn't until she read about the atrocities committed during the Holocaust and the ongoing fight against systemic racism that she truly found her calling. 
				<sup>8</sup>The unfair treatment of marginalized communities and the failure of the justice system to protect their basic human rights inspired her to pursue a career as a lawyer. 
				<sup>9</sup>She was determined to use her education and passion to make a difference in the lives of those who have been unjustly oppressed and to work towards creating a more equitable society.
				<sup>10</sup>Through her studies and experiences, she hoped to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to be a voice for the voiceless and a champion for justice.
				<sup>11</sup>However, when I shared my aspirations with my family, they discouraged me, telling me that as a woman, I was not fit for a career in law.
				<sup>12</sup>They believed that women were too emotional to be effective lawyers, and she was crushed.

			    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<sup>13</sup><b><i>Due to lack of support from her family, she became lost.</b></i>
				<sup>14</sup>She did not know what else to do and this was when she accidentally discovered her talent for arts.
				<sup>15</sup>Marian was an average student who had never considered herself to be particularly talented in the arts. 
				<sup>16</sup>One day in TLE class, her teacher assigned them to draw.
				<sup>17</sup>As she began to sketch, her teacher noticed her innate ability for capturing the intricate details and creating a lifelike representation. 
				<sup>18</sup>This discovery came as a surprise to Marian, who had never considered herself to be an artist.
				<sup>19</sup> But as she continued to hone her skills, she realized that she had a real talent for drawing and painting. 
				<sup>20</sup>This accidental discovery in the art class changed the course of Marian's life.
				<sup>21</sup>She spent the majority of her days creating art, drawing, painting, and photographing different people and places almost every day.
				<sup>22</sup>And that made her very happy, <i>almost.</i>

				<sup>1</sup>Marian had originally wanted to study Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts, but due to financial constraints, she was discouraged to take that course. 
				<sup>2</sup>Lost and unsure of what course she would take, she decided to take a gap year because everything was just too much for her to handle. 
				<sup>3</sup>Unfortunately, the year was 2020 and the world was facing the outbreak of the pandemic.
