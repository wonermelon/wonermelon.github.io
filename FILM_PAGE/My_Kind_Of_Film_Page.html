					<p class="paragraph">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I loved about this movie is how it skillfully interweaves two love stories from different eras to create a captivating and heartwarming narrative.

The acting is top-notch, with standout performances from the entire cast, and the breathtaking cinematography captures the beauty of the North Carolina mountains where the story takes place.
